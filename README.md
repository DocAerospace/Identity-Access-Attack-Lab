# Identity & Access Attack Lab

This repository documents a hands on identity security lab focused on simulating real-world identity based attack scenarios within a Microsoft Entra ID environment.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of identity security, including authentication abuse, access control weaknesses, detection techniques, and mitigation strategies, without relying on a SIEM platform.

The lab follows a structured approach commonly used in enterprise security operations and blue team investigations.
