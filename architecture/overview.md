# Lab Overview

This lab simulates identity based attack scenarios within a Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

The objective is to analyze how identity misconfigurations and authentication weaknesses can be abused, and how such activity can be detected and mitigated using native cloud capabilities.

---

## Core Focus Areas

- Identity-based attack techniques  
- Authentication and authorization behavior  
- Detection using sign-in and audit logs  
- Security control validation  

---

## Architecture Overview

The lab environment consists of:

- Microsoft Entra ID tenant  
- Multiple user accounts with varying privilege levels  
- Conditional Access policies  
- Native logging and monitoring capabilities  

---

## Identity Flow

1. User authentication attempt  
2. Policy evaluation through Conditional Access  
3. Log generation and activity recording  
4. Detection of anomalous behavior  
5. Application of mitigation measures

## Threat Model

The lab focuses on the following threats:
- Credential misuse  
- Unauthorized access attempts  
- Excessive or misused privileges  
- Identity based persistence mechanisms  

---

## Exclusions

The following areas are intentionally excluded:
- Malware development  
- Endpoint exploitation  
- Network level attacks  

For the maintenance of a clear focus on identity security.
