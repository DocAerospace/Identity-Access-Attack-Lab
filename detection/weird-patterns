# Suspicious Identity Activity Patterns

This document outlines suspicious authentication patterns identified during the identity compromise scenario.

---

## Pattern 1: Password Spraying Behavior

### Description
Multiple authentication attempts were made using a limited number of passwords across several user accounts.

### Indicators
- Repeated login failures across distinct usernames  
- Consistent source IP address  
- Uniform authentication method  

### Risk
This pattern indicates an attempt to discover valid credentials while avoiding account lockouts.

## Pattern 2: Authentication Success Following Failures

### Description
A successful authentication occurred after multiple failed attempts.

### Indicators
- Successful sign in from the same IP used during failures  
- Absence of MFA challenge  
- Normal user role access  

### Risk
Indicates potential credential compromise.

## Pattern 3: Lack of Conditional Access Enforcement

### Description
Authentication was allowed without additional verification despite abnormal behavior.

### Indicators
- No Conditional Access policy triggered  
- No stepup authentication required  

### Risk
Increases exposure to unauthorized access and lateral movement.

## Summary

| Pattern | Detection Method | Risk Level |
| Password spraying | Sign in failure correlation | Medium |
| Successful compromise | Login success after failures | High |
| Missing access controls | Policy evaluation logs | Medium |

## Improvement recommendations

- Implement Conditional Access based on risk level  
- Enforce MFA for all users  
- Monitor authentication failure patterns  
- Create alerts for anomalous sign in behavior

## Notes

Identity based attacks often precede privilege escalation or persistence techniques. Early detection significantly reduces impact and dwell time.
