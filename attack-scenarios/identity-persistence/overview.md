# Identity Persistence

This scenario demonstrates how persistence can be established within an identity environment by leveraging legitimate identity features rather than malware or exploits.

The objective is to show how an attacker can maintain long term access using identity based mechanisms that often remain undetected.

---

## Scenario Overview

After gaining initial access and sufficient privileges, persistence is established through identity configuration changes that survive password resets and user lifecycle events.

This scenario focuses on:
- Persistence through identity configuration
- Abuse of trusted authentication mechanisms
- Limited detection by default security controls

---

## Objectives

- Establish long term access using identity features
- Avoid triggering security alerts
- Maintain access without continuous interaction
- Demonstrate detection blind spots

---

## Expected Outcome

- Persistent access remains after credential changes
- Activity is logged but not flagged as malicious
- Identity based persistence is confirmed
