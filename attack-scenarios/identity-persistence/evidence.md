# Evidence

---

## Audit Log Review

- Identity configuration changes were logged
- Authentication events confirm persistent access
- No alerts triggered by default security policies

---

## Observations

- Persistence techniques blend into normal administrative behavior
- Identity based persistence is difficult to detect without context
- Logging exists but requires active review

---

## Risk Summary

Persistence through identity mechanisms allows:
- Long term unauthorized access
- Stealthy lateral movement
- Abuse of trusted identity relationships
